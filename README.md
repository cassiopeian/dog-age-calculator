## Inspiration

 This project has its roots in a Codecademy lesson on the use of math operators and variables in JavaScript. The original project was limited to the console, but I wanted to build a visual interface. I designed a GUI with an input that accepts numbers, along with a *Submit* button that sends the output to the dogâ€™s speech bubble.  

I also used this project to practice using `Math.random` to generate random responses from the dog I drew in Illustrator.

## Tech Specs

 Dog Age Calculator was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
