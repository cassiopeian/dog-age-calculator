 Using super-sophisticated canine math, [Dog-Age Calculator](https://cassiopeian.github.io/dog-age-calculator/) converts your human age into dog years.

 Enter your age on the dotted pink line, and click *Submit*. The updated speech bubble will: 
 + Reveal your dog age
 + Remind you of your human age
 + Generate a random quip

 This project has its roots in a Codecademy JavaScript lesson that prompted me to:
 + create variables
 + use math operators, including `*=`, the multiplication assignment operator 
 + modify a string with the `.toLowerCase()` method
 + use string interpolation within a `console.log()` statement
 
 The original project was limited to the console, but I wanted to build a visual interface. I designed a GUI with an input that accepts numbers, along with a *Submit* button that sends the output to the dogâ€™s speech bubble.  

 I also used this project to practice using `Math.random()` to generate random responses from the dog I drew in Illustrator.

## Tech Specs

 Dog-Age Calculator was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
